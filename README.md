# Javascript Quiz

## Mini Javi Quiz

- I was motivated by learning how to use JS
- I built this project to learn how to use JS , CSS, and HTML all together
- I had a problem with toggling on my JS but I was able to do some study group sessions which helped me pick up on new things.
- I learned that little by little, I'm officially learning to code!
